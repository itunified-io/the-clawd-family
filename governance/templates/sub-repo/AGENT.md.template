# AGENT.md – Sub-repo Governance

**Governed by:** The Clawd Family
**Governance Version:** (auto-detected from RAG)

---

## Governance RAG Access

All governance policies (roles, gates, memory, conflict rules) are served via
The Clawd Family RAG API. This file does NOT contain governance rules inline.

### Connection

```
API Base URL: http://localhost:3000/api/governance
```

### Session Start

At session start, query governance for your role-specific policies:

```
POST /api/governance/search
{
  "query": "What are my mandatory workflow steps?",
  "role": "<AGENT_ROLE>",
  "repo": "<REPO_NAME>"
}
```

Cache the response for the session duration.

### When RAG is Unavailable

**STOP — ASK HUMAN. No file fallback, no guessing.**

RAG is part of the Docker Compose stack (always-on). Unavailability indicates
an infrastructure issue that requires human intervention.
